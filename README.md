# Astrophysics Research & Infrastructure Tools

An example of my Python-based research infrastructure and analysis tools developed for large-scale astrophysical data processing, featuring machine learning (ML) implementations and statistical analysis frameworks.

## Overview

This repository contains example code used in published research on dark matter halo dynamics and weak lensing. The class-object oriented code and tools were used for processing large-scale cosmological datasets and implementing various ML and advanced statistical techniques for parameter space exploration.

### Key Features

- Object-oriented framework for cosmological data analysis
- Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation to research multi-dimensional parameter space
- Statistical analysis tools (bootstrapping, MCMC, etc.)
- Visualization modules for high-dimensional data representation
- Scalable data processing pipelines for large astronomical datasets
