description: 'Binned bias and velocity profiles for the halo parameters considered in Fong & Han 2020 (arXiv: 2008.03477). The depletion, splashback, turnaround, and virial radii and their corresponding enclosed masses are also provided, when halos are binned by virial mass. Lastly the characteristic overdensities for the depletion, splashback, and turnaround radii are also included, when halos are binned by virial mass. An example code is included, showing how the h5py files are accessed along with some example plots. For more details please refer to the paper above.'
